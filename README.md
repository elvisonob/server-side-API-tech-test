This is a Node.js service that uses the GitHub API to allow users to query repositories by name, fetch repository details, and retrieve README files.

The server is set on port 8080 and the query link for postman is below:

`http://localhost:8080/api/github/repositories?name=${githubusername}`

## Features

- Search for GitHub repositories by name.
- Retrieve repository details such as forks, open issues, url, and README content.
- Built using **Express.js** and **Axios** for API handling.
- Implements error handling and best practices.

## ðŸš€ Potential Enhancements

While the API is fully functional, future iterations could include:

- **Rate Limiting Optimization**: Implementing advanced request limiting to prevent excessive API calls.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Using Redis or in-memory caching to reduce redundant GitHub API requests.
