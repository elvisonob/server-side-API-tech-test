This is a Node.js service that uses the GitHub API to allow users to query repositories by name, fetch repository details, and retrieve README files.

The server is set on port 8080 and the query link for postman is below:

`http://localhost:8080/api/github/repositories?name=${githubusername}`

## Features

- Search for GitHub repositories by name.
- Retrieve repository details such as forks, open issues, url, and README content.
- Built using **Express.js** and **Axios** for API handling.
- Implements error handling and best practices.

## ðŸ”¥ Future Improvements

- **Implementing Rate Limiting**:  
  Currently, the API does not enforce rate-limiting. In the future, I plan to:
  - Introduce request limits using `express-rate-limit` to prevent excessive API calls.
  - Optimize rate-limiting to avoid blocking legitimate users while ensuring fair usage.
  - Consider caching mechanisms (like Redis) to reduce repeated API calls and improve performance.
